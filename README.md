# Todolist_version1
Web Development project

The tool used to built this project 
EJS (Html, CSS), Lodash, Mongo DB, Git, Express, Javascript

Ejs: was very useful for dynamic templating where I could make a client side having both Html/css and  inline javacript

Mongo DB:was the best and most convient database tech I have used so far. CRUD operation was so much easier to perform.
I setup the free version of Mongo Atlas (cloud services) that allows me to store/delete database with have a local server so I can
scale it later on. 

Express: I used this mostly for the server part so the listen/ get()/post()

â€¢	Allows user to write and remove their to-do-list for the day and store or removes the data 
in a Mongo DB database which resides the cloud services called Mongo Atlas
